        <h3 class="text-center">Summary</h3>
        <p>
            BTS (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan), also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a seven-member South
            Korean
            boy band that was formed in 2010 and debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment. The septet—composed of
            Jin,
            Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook—co-writes and co-produces much of their own output. Originally
            a hip
            hop group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres.

        <h3 class="text-center">Formation and Early Years</h3>
        <p>
            BTS began its formation in 2010 after Big Hit Entertainment CEO Bang Si-hyuk met with group leader RM
            and was
            impressed with his rapping. The lineup was finalized with Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook
            in
            2012 when Jin, the oldest member of the group, was twenty-years-old. Six months prior to their debut,
            they
            began to gain attention for their presence on various social media websites, as well as song covers on
            YouTube
            and SoundCloud.

        <h3 class="text-center">Mainstream and International Breakthrough</h3>
        <p>
            In November 2017, BTS became the first K-pop group to perform at the American Music Awards, raising
            their
            profile internationally. That same month, Guinness World Records revealed that BTS had earned a spot in
            their
            2018 edition for "having the world's most Twitter engagements for a music group". In December, they also
            became the first K-pop group to perform on Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve to welcome the new year
            and
            made their Japanese TV music show debut on TV Asahi's Japan Music Station Super Live.

        <h3 class="text-center">Cultural Impact</h3>
        <p>
            Billboard's Senior Vice President Silvio Pietroluongo said that BTS are comparable to and as influential
            as
            the Beatles and the Monkees. Nielsen Music Vice President Helena Kosinski said that "although BTS
            weren't the
            first to open the doors to K-Pop worldwide, they were the first to become mainstream. They don't just
            appeal
            to young people but also to the 50s and 60s age demographic." As the first non-English speaking artist
            to
            make the Global Artist Chart in 2018, BTS had the second and third best-selling albums worldwide and
            were the
            second best-selling artists worldwide in terms of physical, digital, and streaming platforms, coming
            second
            only to Drake.
